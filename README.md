# Movie Rater ðŸŽ¬â€‹

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/it)
* [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
* [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for the API requests
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) as a CSS framework I have opted for
* [Material-UI](https://mui.com/)
* [Intellij IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/it/java/technologies/downloads/)
* [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Render](https://render.com/) for the deployment of the backend server
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for the deployment of the frontend

## Installation
First of all, you need Node.js, and JDK installed.
If you don't have it, you can download it here:
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/it/download/)<br>
[JDK](https://www.oracle.com/it/java/technologies/downloads/)<br>


### 1 - Clone the repository
```bash

git clone https://github.com/R3ddy95/MovieRater.git

```

### 2 - BackEnd
First of all you need to deploy the back end, although to make it work you should have a database already working.
I used MongoDB, if you use the same one, you have to create a .env file in the src/main/resource directory with the data entered, I created a .env.example file to have an example of how you should configure it.
However, if you don't want to do it yourself, you can simply start the JAR file in the target directory inside the MovieServer folder.


### 3 - FrontEnd
Once the server is started, you just need to start the client side in this way, installing the dependencies first:

```bash

npm install

```

Once installed, create an env file. inside the root directory with exactly this inside:

```env

REACT_APP_API_KEY=http://localhost:8080

```
However, keep in mind that the server is started on port 8080, this could change if you have opted for changes

### 4 - Run it!
```bash

npm start

```

and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
